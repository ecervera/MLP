    "An automatic road sign recognition system first locates road signs within images captured by an imaging sensor on-board of a vehicle, and then identifies road signs assisting the driver to properly operate the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated road sign recognition is a difficult task. There are a number of important issues that need to be taken into consideration. These include: illumination conditions, direction of sign's face, status of paint on signs, placement of multiple signs near each other, torn and tilted signs, variations in sign's scale, obstacles such as tree, image sensor's properties, car vibrations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the road sign has been previously located in the image, neural networks may be employed to implement the classification module because they have proven to be good classifiers and have been able to successfully solve several object recognition problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will work on a classification task of several road signs with neural networks. The images will be obtained from [a large, lifelike database of traffic sign images: the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news)."
